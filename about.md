### Who am I?

I am currently in my final semester at USC, where I am obtaining my Master's degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Data Science. I did my undergraduate studies at UC San Diego, where I received my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics along with a minor in Computer Science.

Within the field of Data Science, I am particularly interested in predictive analytics, basketball analytics, and social media analytics.
