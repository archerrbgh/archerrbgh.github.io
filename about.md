### Who am I?

I am currently in my final semester at USC, where I am obtaining my Master's degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Data Science. I did my undergraduate studies at UC San Diego, where I received my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics along with a minor in Computer Science.

I enjoy working on Artificial Intelligence projects, especially those using Machine Learning.
