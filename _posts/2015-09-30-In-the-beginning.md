## In the beginning...

Hey there!

My name is Andrew Hwang, and I am currently in my final semester at USC, where I am getting my Master's in Computer Science, with a focus on Data Science.

I'm hoping to use this website/blog as a way to talk about some of the work I am doing (both general software engineering and data science) or random thoughts I have on random things. Hope you enjoy the upcoming content!
