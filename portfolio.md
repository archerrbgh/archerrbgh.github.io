##Projects

###Analysis of Serious Game
####MIT Lincoln Laboratory (Lexington, MA)
Worked with Dr. Robert Seater and his team at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to analyze game playing strategies for a lightweight disaster management serious game. A game playing agent was created using a modified version of Monte Carlo Tree Search.

###HANA Studio plug-in prototype
####SAP Labs (Palo Alto, CA)
Created confidential plug-in prototype as intern at SAP Labs. The prototype was built for SAP's commercial software HANA Studio, and was built using Maven and Java.

###NBA Player Performance Prediction
####UC San Diego MATH 111A-B(La Jolla, CA)
Using previous performance data and a player similarity metric, future performance prediction was attempted. Predictions were based on the performance of players similar to the one being looked at. K-means clustering and the cosine distance metric were used to determine player similarity. A number of basic statistics like points and rebounds per game were predicted.

###Sports Team Ranking
####UC San Diego Graduate Undergraduate Learning Program (La Jolla, CA)
Using a modified form of Google's PageRank algorithm, a rudimentary power ranking system was created. At the start of the season, all teams have the same number of "fans". When team A beats team B, fans of team B "bandwagon" to team A with a given probability. The team with the most fans at the end is the highest ranked team. Ranking was dependent on the probability chosen.

###Wine Website
####UC San Diego CSE 110(La Jolla, CA)
Worked in group of 10 to create a wine inventory and recommendation website for software engineering class. The website was primarily built using Python, Flask, HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Recommendations were made based on wines in the user's inventory and wishlist. The website was voted as the best project in the class, out of 20 total projects.
